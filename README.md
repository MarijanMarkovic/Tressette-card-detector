# Tressette-card-detector
This is a python program that uses openCV and Tensorflow to detect tresette playing cards.
Tressette card detector was trained on a pretrained efficientdet_d1_coco17_tpu-32 downloaded from [Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)
